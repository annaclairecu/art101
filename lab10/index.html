				<h1> Lab 10: Javascript Events and Forms </h1>
        <h1> Challenges </h1>
        <p> This lab was quite interesting, but a little difficult. We wrote our HTML code well and only had to rearrange where we added some divs. When writing our Javascript code however, we were coming across a few errors. At first, we could not get our output to print on our website and received many “undefined” errors. When we figured out how to get our output to print and the nameSort function worked properly, we could not get it to print next to our “Hello.” After much trial and error with our TA, we were able to get our code to run the way we wanted it to. </p>
        <h1> Results </h1>
        <p> The results of this lab may be seen once a name is input into the input box and the button is pressed. What will appear is “Hello, [the user’s name sorted].” </p>
        <div id="nameofuser">
          <label for= "user-name"> Input your name: </label>
        <input type="text" id="user-name" />

        <button id="my-button">
              Press Me
        </button>
        </div>
        <div id="output">
          <p> Hello,  </p>
        </div>
