		<h1> Challenges </h1>
			<p> For this lab we did not come across many challenges. We were able to reference our array and object on our console fine, but when we wanted to print the two together, it did not seem to function no matter what we tried. Ultimately, we printed the array and object separately and they both printed properly. Another problem we faced was getting our Script Output to show up on our website. We did not know why the code was not working properly and why our array and object were not showing up. After asking our TA for help, we were able to fix the issue and our code functioned well.

		<h1> Results </h1>
			<p> Our results for this lab can be seen through our website. The code is working properly and our Challenges, Results, and Script Output can be seen. We incorporated two pictures as well which include Annaâ€™s Dodge Ram and a few icons of public transportation, some of which were listed in our Object. Other than a few minor setbacks, this lab was fairly straightforward and we were able to complete it well.
