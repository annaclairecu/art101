	<h1> Challenges </h1>
		<p> This lab was quite straightforward and we did not face many issues. When we began the lab, we were a little confused whether we were to use the “var” function or not in our coding. The example screenshots in the lab did not use the var function, so we asked our TA if it was required to use the function or not and were informed that it is not necessary. The next issue we had was running our Script Output properly. We did not know why our script output was not showing up , but after examining our code we found a typo. We had an extra set of quotation marks around our variable contents. Other than these challenges, we were able to complete the lab in good time and with ease.  </p>

	<h1> Results </h1>
		<p> Our results consist of properly functioning javascript, html, and css programming, which can be seen on our website. Our Javascript output of Anna’s car as well as an image of the car can be seen on our site. Everything seems to be running well and we are pleased with our results.
