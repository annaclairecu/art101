  <h1> Lab 13 - Loops </h1>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p> We were able to set up our html fairly quickly however, we came across a few challenges when trying to complete our javascript. Our first issue was not understanding how to print a function because our original javascript was not in a function. After turning our code into a function, we had difficulty calling the function. Our next issue was that the names did not print, but we learned that they were not in the proper string format, meaning they did not have quotation marks. After much trial and error, and lots of help from our TA, we were able to get our code to display properly on our page.

		<h1>Results</h1>
			<p> Our web page displays the numbers 1-200 with the multiples of 3,5,7 and their respective labels. It took a while to get the code to print, but it now appears properly.
