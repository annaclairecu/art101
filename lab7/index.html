		<h1> Challenges </h1>
			<p> This lab was a little challenging for us! We didn’t quite understand how to make functions work in Javascript, so when we began the lab we were super confused! We ended up using the same function as in the example, because we didn’t really know where to start with making our own. The only challenge we really ran into was our script not showing up when we tested locally, but that was because we had extra quotation marks in our javascript! We also definitely did not know how to tackle some of the bonus tasks, however, we referenced w3 schools to figure it out!

		<h1> Results </h1>
			<p> As for our results, we were able to get our code to function properly (pun intended). Though we were met with some confusion when beginning our work, we were ultimately able to create an index.html for lab 7, create a javascript file, and create a new function. For the Bonus task, we excitingly figured out how to style our Script Output in css which was something we wanted to do for our previous lab. Additionally, we were able to do some research and come to a solution for the other bonus questions.
