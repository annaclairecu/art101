<h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
	<p> The purpose of this lab was to make a homepage that links to all of our individual labs. </p>

	<h1> Challenges We Faced </h1>
		<p> We had an easy time creating the heading and paragraph for our site. However, we came across some issues when we started to add our images. We have 3 images and we really would have liked to have them appear side-by-side. In order to do this, we acquired help from W3schools in using the float property and the flex property. We tried to assign classes to both our images and divs, but overall we could not figure out how to put the images side-by-side. </p>
		<p> The next challenge we encountered was linking our separate lab sites in the  bulleted list on our homepage. When we clicked each separate Lab on the bulleted list, the link seemed to be broken as it would direct us to an Error page. After analysing our code multiple times and cross-referencing it with our lab website that did work, we were able to find the correct solution to our issue. </p>

	<h1> Results </h1>
		<p> After much trial and error, we were able to successfully create a fully functioning bullet list on our website. Though we were unable to arrange our images in the way we liked, we are excited to learn more about CSS and HTML functions as well as how we may incorporate them into our website! </p>
