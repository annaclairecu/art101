				<h1> Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
				<h1> Challenges</h1>
				<p> This lab ended up being super challenging for us. We were both kind of confused about how to create a callback function in Javascript. The first challenge we ran into was using the map function in the console in task 2. We could not get it to return anything, but then we realized that we should have been using the actual word “function” instead of the name of our function. Our biggest challenge, however, was when we were testing our javascript file locally. We could not get it to print locally at all, and it turned out to be a lot of errors in our original javascript file. </p>
				<h1> Results</h1>
				<p> Once we finally found a solution to the challenges we faced in this lab, we were able to get our code to run nicely. Our function ran properly in the console and we are satisfied with our work in getting the code right. We typically are eager to complete the Bonus Tasks as they are a fun little challenge to complete, however we used our utmost effort to complete the main tasks of this lab. We will save the bonus for another day! </p>
