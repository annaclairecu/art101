  <h1> Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies </h1>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p> We decided to go back to our lab 11 and fix our buttons! When we originally submitted, the buttons cascaded, so the top button would control the two buttons below it, and the middle button would control the last button. We were very confused because we were trying to give the buttons IDs to differentiate them, which was not working.
</p>

<div>
		<h1>Results</h1>
			<p> We ended up fixing this by referring to the buttons with their different variable names, using jQuery format! Now each button only controls its corresponding text.
