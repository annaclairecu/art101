        <h1> Challenges </h1>
        <p> We got through the first part of this lab pretty easily! We had good notes from the lecture, and also were able to refer back to the slides when we needed help. We ran into some challenges when trying to complete the Bonus task though. We were attempting to have a description for each house pop up with the house that the user is sorted into. We decided to add the same mod function, except instead of returning the name of the house, it returns a description. We then added it to our final print in our output div. Next, we really wanted our descriptions to have a different font, size, and color than our house names, so we tried a bunch of different things. We tried to add IDs to multiple different parts of our javascript, and then we tried to edit the style of the IDs in both CSS and within Javascript. Nothing we tried would affect the font of our description, though we did break our function a few times. </p>
        <h1> Results </h1>
        <p> Though we were unable to change the font of our descriptions, we did end up with a function that works properly, and also outputs a description of each house! </p>
        <div class = "input-output">
        Please enter your full name for sorting:
        <input type="text"  id="input">
        <button id="button"> Submit</button>
        <div id= "output">
