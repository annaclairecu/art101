     <p id="p1">  We were definitely challenged by this lab, however, after a lot of trial and error, we ended up figuring it out ourselves! The first challenge that we ran into was that the button would not change the color of the text, even though we had the CSS correct. As it turned out, we were trying to refer to the button by its variable, and we should have been referring to it by just the name of the element, “button.” After this, it ended up working!

    <p id="p2"> The only problem with our site that we couldn’t fix is that the top button also controls the button under it, and the middle button controls the button under it. It seems that they are all linked to the elements below them. However, since we created the buttons in jQuery, we were unable to add an ID to the buttons to differentiate them.  </p>

     <p id="p3"> Overall, this lab was very successful for us. We ultimately were able to complete it without help, and when we had issues, we spent time doing trial and error to figure it out. We are very happy with how our buttons work!
