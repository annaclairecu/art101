	<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p> For this lab, we did not come across too many challenges thankfully. At first, we had difficulty in deciding what computer task we would like to break down into programming comments, but ultimately decided on programming a Chess game. We were able to write our high-level programming comments for Chess, but when we began writing our author block, we became confused. We were unsure how long our summary should be and what we should input in the link and file section of the block. After asking our TA, we were told to put “lab4.js” in the file section and to link our Github website in the link section. </p>

		<h1>Results</h1>
			<p> As for results, we were able to complete each task given to us. The javascript code has appeared nicely on our website and did not collapse thanks to the pre-code step. Our index.html functions properly and the CSS stylesheets have transferred to our Lab 4 page successfully. For our everyday task we chose to pseudocode how to create a ceramic mug, as this is a task group member Anna does practically every other day. Our pseudocode includes high-level tasks as well as sub-steps to break down more complicated steps.
